    "## Importing Modules\n",

    "All Python programs can call a basic set of functions called built-in functions, including the print(), input(), and len() functions you’ve seen before. Python also comes with a set of modules called the standard library. Each module is a Python program that contains a related group of functions that can be embedded in your programs. For example, the math module has mathematics-related functions, the random module has random number-related functions, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can use the functions in a module, you must import the module with an import statement. In code, an import statement consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The import keyword\n",
    "    The name of the module\n",
    "    Optionally, more module names, as long as they are separated by commas\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you import a module, you can use all the cool functions of that module. Let’s give it a try with the random module, which will give us access to the random.randint() function."

However, you can cause the program to terminate, or exit, before the last instruction by calling the sys.exit() function.

    "By using expressions that evaluate to True or False (also called conditions), you can write programs that make decisions on what code to execute and what code to skip. You can also execute code over and over again in a loop while a certain condition evaluates to True. The break and continue statements are useful if you need to exit a loop or jump back to the loop’s start.\n",
